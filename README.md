Phishing sites are designed to trick Internet users into entering sensitive information and are difficult to detect because they look legitimate. Techniques such as machine learning, feature-based analysis and heuristics have been developed, but  due to the evolving nature of these sites, further research is needed. Despite detection techniques, phishing sites are still a serious threat. Internet users must be careful when surfing the web, because even the most advanced technologies cannot fully protect against phishing attacks. Despite the advances in these technologies, phishing sites are still a serious threat. This is partly due  to the constant evolution of these sites, which makes them difficult to detect with static techniques. Therefore, further research is needed to develop more effective techniques to detect phishing sites. In conclusion, detecting phishing sites is a complex and ongoing challenge. Various techniques have been developed to identify phishing sites, but new techniques are needed to keep up with the ever-evolving nature of these sites. Finally, it is important for Internet users to be alert and cautious when browsing the Internet, as even the most advanced detection technologies cannot fully protect against phishing attacks.
